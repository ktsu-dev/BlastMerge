## HEADERS

-   All files must have a header specifying the copyright license (MIT).
-   All top-level classes must have a summary describing their purpose.
-   Always use meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes.
-   Code must be well-commented, explaining non-obvious logic.

## PROJECT DOCUMENTATION & CONTEXT SYSTEM

-   Use SpecStory to generate markdown files documenting user requests and assistant responses.

## CODING STANDARDS

-   Follow Microsoft's C# coding conventions.
-   Use `var` keyword for local variable declarations when the type is obvious.
-   Always handle exceptions gracefully, logging errors and providing informative messages to the user.
-   Validate all method parameters for null values, throwing `ArgumentNullException` when appropriate.
-   Fix formatting issues.
-   Use expression body for methods.
-   Collection initialization can be simplified.
-   When logging or handling exceptions, catch specific exception types (e.g., `IOException`, `UnauthorizedAccessException`) rather than a general `Exception` to provide more targeted error handling.
-   Use `ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull` instead of explicitly throwing a new exception instance.
-   Use pattern matching.
-   Follow the .editorconfig file.
-   Private member 'FileHasher.FNV_PRIME_32' is unused (https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/style-rules/ide0051)
-   Private member 'FileHasher.FNV_OFFSET_BASIS_32' is unused (https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/style-rules/ide0051)
-   Parentheses should be added for clarity (https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/style-rules/ide0048)
-   Add braces to 'if' statement. (https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/style-rules/ide0011)

## FILE & DIRECTORY HANDLING

-   Always ensure that file paths are valid before attempting to access files.
-   Create target directories before copying files.
-   When copying files, handle potential `IOExceptions` and `UnauthorizedAccessExceptions`.
-   Be aware that binary files will be treated as text and should show differences.

## HASHING

-   Use FNV-1a (64-bit version) as the hashing algorithm for file identification.
-   Handle files with different encodings.

## DIFFING

-   Use the Myers diff algorithm for detecting differences between files.
-   Generate diff output in a git-style format.
-   Color-code the diff output:
    -   Green for added lines
    -   Red for deleted lines
    -   Cyan for chunk headers
    -   Blue for file headers
-   Show the paths of the compared versions.
-   Implement a change summary diffing mode that shows only lines added or removed between versions.
-   In GenerateGitStyleDiff, check if `k-1+max` or `k+1+max` is out of bounds.
-   In BacktrackPath, use a simpler approach for very large files to avoid index errors.
-   In BacktrackPath, implement a try/catch to handle IndexOutOfRangeException and fallback to a simple edit script if the algorithm fails.

## DEBUGGING

-   When an error occurs, log the error message and rethrow the exception for debugging purposes.

## UNIT TESTING

-   Write comprehensive unit tests using MSTest.
-   Use a mock filesystem to enable parallel test execution and avoid file system conflicts.
-   Create test cases for different scenarios, including normal usage patterns and edge cases.
-   Use setup and cleanup methods to maintain a clean testing environment.
-   Create tests for performance benchmarking, especially for large files and directories.
-   Implement tests for mock file system operations to verify correct behavior with mocked dependencies.
-   Test file operations with relative paths.
-   Test file operations with paths containing trailing slashes.
-   Test file operations with paths using different casing.
-   Test file operations with multiple search patterns.
-   Test with files in deep directory structures.
-   Test with symbolic links, but skip if the test environment does not support them.

## WORKFLOW & RELEASE RULES

-   Ensure that all tests pass before releasing a new version.
