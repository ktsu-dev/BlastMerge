Looking at your .editorconfig file, you can silence IDE0010 and IDE0072 by adding the following diagnostic severity settings. I'll add them to the appropriate section of your file:

I've added the diagnostic severity settings to silence both IDE rules:

- **IDE0010** ("Populate switch") - This rule suggests adding missing cases to switch statements
- **IDE0072** ("Populate switch expression") - This rule suggests adding missing cases to switch expressions

Both are now set to `severity = none` which will suppress these warnings/suggestions in your IDE. The rules are placed in the "Static code analysis rules" section alongside your other diagnostic configurations for consistency.
