# Resolve LINQ loop simplification error (2025-06-07 23:39:40)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Loops should be simplified using the "Where" LINQ method [+1 location]
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

Looking at the code, I can see two loops that can be simplified using the "Where" LINQ method:

1. **In `ProcessCurrentDirectory` method** - filtering files before processing
2. **In `ShouldExcludePath` method** - filtering out null/whitespace patterns

The error has been resolved by simplifying two loops using the "Where" LINQ method:

1. **In `ProcessCurrentDirectory`**: Filtered files before iterating instead of using an if statement inside the loop
2. **In `ShouldExcludePath`**: Filtered out null/whitespace patterns before iterating instead of using continue statements

These changes make the code more concise and follow LINQ best practices by filtering collections upfront rather than using conditional logic inside loops.
