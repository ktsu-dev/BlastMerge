# Changelog generation error troubleshooting (2025-06-03 13:31:01)

I still cant get a real changelog, compare my terminal output to this error:

I can see the issue! The error shows that the PowerShell script is trying to access a `Count` property on an object that doesn't have it. This typically happens when the git log command returns a single commit (as a string) instead of an array, but the script expects an array.

Let me examine the PSBuild.psm1 file to see the changelog generation code:

Let me look specifically at the changelog generation code around line 930-970:

Read file: scripts/PSBuild.psm1

Let me also check for the `ConvertTo-ArraySafe` function that seems to be handling the conversion:

I found the issue! The problem is in the changelog generation code. When the `git log` command returns a single commit (like in your case), PowerShell treats it as a string rather than an array. However, the code later tries to access the `.Count` property which doesn't exist on strings.

Looking at the error and the terminal output you provided, the git command returned:
```
bece23d|Enhance error handling in PSBuild.psm1 for changelog generation|matt-edmondson
```

This is a single string, not an array. The code tries to call `.Count` on this string, which fails.

Let me look for where this specific error might be occurring by checking line 937 more closely:

The issue is clear now. The problem is that `ConvertTo-ArraySafe` is being called correctly, but there's still code that's accessing `.Count` on objects that might not have this property. 

The core issue is that when `git log` returns a single commit as a string, PowerShell doesn't automatically give it a `.Count` property. However, the `ConvertTo-ArraySafe` function should be handling this.

Looking more closely at the `ConvertTo-ArraySafe` function, I see that it might not be working as expected. Let me check if there's an issue with how it's being called. The problem is likely that the `ConvertTo-ArraySafe` function is not ensuring the object has a `.Count` property in all cases.

Let me fix this by modifying the `ConvertTo-ArraySafe` function to always return a proper array:

---

```diff
      )

      }
  
      try {

+         }
+         elseif ($InputObject -is [string] -and $InputObject.Contains("`n")) {

      }
  }
```

Now I need to add additional safety checks in the places where `.Count` is being accessed. Let me add some defensive programming around the problematic areas:

---

Read file: scripts/PSBuild.psm1

I need to add some helper functions to safely check for Count properties. Let me add a safer way to check the count:

                  }

Now I need to also fix the other Count property access later in the function:

---

```diff
      foreach ($commit in $rawCommits) {
          $parts = $commit -split '\|'
-         if ($parts.Count -ge 3) {
+         # Use @() subexpression to safely get count
+         if (@($parts).Count -ge 3) {
              $structuredCommits += [PSCustomObject]@{
                  Hash = $parts[0]
```

```diff
      $uniqueCommits = ConvertTo-ArraySafe -InputObject ($structuredCommits | Sort-Object -Property Hash -Unique | ForEach-Object { $_.FormattedEntry })
  
-     Write-Information "Found $($uniqueCommits.Count) commits for $ToTag" -Tags "Get-VersionNotes"
+     # Use @() subexpression to safely get count
+     $uniqueCommitsCount = @($uniqueCommits).Count
+     Write-Information "Found $uniqueCommitsCount commits for $ToTag" -Tags "Get-VersionNotes"
  
      # Format changelog entry
      $versionChangelog = ""
-     if ($uniqueCommits.Count -gt 0) {
+     if ($uniqueCommitsCount -gt 0) {
          $versionChangelog = "## $ToTag"
          if ($versionType -ne "unknown") {
```

---

Now let's test the fix by running the changelog generation again. The changes I made should resolve the "Count property cannot be found" error by:

1. **Fixed `ConvertTo-ArraySafe` function**: Made it more robust to always return proper arrays with the comma operator `,[object[]]@()` to force array context.

2. **Added safe count checks**: Replaced direct `.Count` property access with `@($variable).Count` which works for both arrays and strings.

3. **Improved error handling**: Added better null checks and fallbacks.

Let's test the fix:

---

```bash
cd C:\dev\ktsu-dev\BlastMerge && powershell -Command "Import-Module .\scripts\PSBuild.psm1 -Force; Get-VersionNotes -Tags @() -FromTag 'v1.0.17' -ToTag 'v1.0.18' -ToSha 'bece23dcba4f942f3b377e6cf3b828546029ebab'"
```

compare the Invoke-ExpressionWithLogging function that were using to invoke the git log

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the `Invoke-ExpressionWithLogging` function that's being used to execute the git log command:

---

Read file: scripts/PSBuild.psm1

---

Now I can see the issue! The problem is **not** with the `Invoke-ExpressionWithLogging` function itself. Looking at your terminal output, I can see that the git command is actually working correctly and returning exactly what we expect:

```
bece23d|Enhance error handling in PSBuild.psm1 for changelog generation|matt-edmondson
```

This is a **single string result**, not an array. The issue is that when PowerShell gets a single result from a command, it returns it as a string, not as an array with one element. 

The `Invoke-ExpressionWithLogging` function works fine - it executes the command and returns the result. The problem occurs later when the code tries to access the `.Count` property on this single string.

Looking at how the git command is called in the changelog generation:
