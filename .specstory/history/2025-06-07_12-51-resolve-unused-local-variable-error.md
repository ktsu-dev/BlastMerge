# Resolve unused local variable error (2025-06-07 22:51:54)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Remove the unused local variable 'subdir1'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

Looking at the code, the variables `subdir1` and `subdir2` are created but never used. They can be safely removed since the code already uses string interpolation to create the file paths directly.
