Looking at the code, I can see the nested ternary operation in the `DetermineBlockType` method. Here's the issue:

```csharp
private static string DetermineBlockType(DiffPlex.Model.DiffBlock diffBlock)
{
    return diffBlock.DeleteCountA > 0 && diffBlock.InsertCountB > 0
        ? "Replace"
        : diffBlock.InsertCountB > 0 ? "Insert" : diffBlock.DeleteCountA > 0 ? "Delete" : "Unchanged";
}
```

The nested ternary after the first `:` should be extracted. Here's the fix:

The nested ternary operation has been extracted into independent if statements, making the code more readable and resolving the linter error. Each condition is now clearly separated and easier to understand.
