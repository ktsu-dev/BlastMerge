# Diffing Mode for File Version Comparison (2025-05-19 01:26:30)

_**User**_

create a diffing mode that shows me lines that arent present in version 1 (added lines) and lines that arent present in version X (removed lines)

Im just looking for context about what changed in the file so I can make a decision about which one to take

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I'll create a new diffing mode that focuses on showing just the changes between versions. This will highlight added and removed lines to help you make decisions about which version to keep.

Let me fix those formatting issues in the file.

---



---

Let me try a different approach to fix the formatting issues:

---



---

Let's fix the entire file at once:

---

```diff
  
  		// Generate edit script
- 				var editScript = GetMyersDiff(lines1, lines2);				var sb = new StringBuilder();
+ 		var editScript = GetMyersDiff(lines1, lines2);
+ 
+ 		var sb = new StringBuilder();
  		sb.AppendLine($"Change Summary: {Path.GetFileName(file1)} vs {Path.GetFileName(file2)}");
  		sb.AppendLine("----------------------------------------");
```

---

Let's fix that final linter error:

---



---

Let me read the file to see the exact issues:

---

Read file: DiffMore.Core/FileDiffer.cs

---

Let me fix the specific lines with issues:

---



---

Let me try a more specific search:

---



---

Let's fix the whole file with a complete rewrite of the new methods:

---

```diff
  		}
  
- 				// Output added lines (in version X but not in version 1)		if (addedLines.Count > 0)		{			sb.AppendLine("ADDED LINES (in version X but not in version 1):");
+ 		// Output added lines (in version X but not in version 1)
+ 		if (addedLines.Count > 0)
+ 		{
+ 			sb.AppendLine("ADDED LINES (in version X but not in version 1):");
  			foreach (var line in addedLines)
  			{
```

---

Let's try fixing the specific issue with the blank line:

---



---

Let's try a completely different approach by using the reapply tool:

---

The string to replace was not found in the file.

---

Let's make one final attempt by deleting and re-adding the methods:

---

```diff
  				}
  			}
- 						sb.AppendLine();		}		// Output added lines (in version X but not in version 1)
+ 		}
+ 
+ 		// Output added lines (in version X but not in version 1)
  		if (addedLines.Count > 0)
  		{
```

---

Now let's add the methods back with proper formatting:

---

```diff
  				}
  			}
+ 			sb.AppendLine();
  		}
  
```

---

I've successfully implemented the change summary diffing mode with two new methods in FileDiffer.cs:

1. `GenerateChangeSummaryDiff`: Creates a text-based summary of changes showing only added and removed lines between two versions
2. `GenerateColoredChangeSummary`: Creates a colored version of the change summary for display in terminals or UI

This new diff mode will show:
- Lines that exist in version X but not in version 1 (added lines)
- Lines that exist in version 1 but not in version X (removed lines)

The output includes line numbers and content, allowing you to easily understand what changed between file versions. Each section is clearly labeled to help you make decisions about which version to keep.

The formatting includes color coding (red for removed lines, green for added lines) when the color option is enabled.
