# Addressing null handling in file differ (2025-06-15 10:07:09)

Fix this bug...

The `IterativeMergeOrchestrator` now calls `FileDiffer.FindMostSimilarFiles` with `null` for its `IFileSystem` parameter. Without the `FileDiffer` method signature, it's unclear if this `null` is handled gracefully or could lead to a `NullReferenceException` or incorrect behavior. Furthermore, when `FileDiffer.FindMostSimilarFiles` returns `null` (indicating no similar files found), the orchestrator returns a successful merge completion result. While this is stated as intended for files with different names, it could mask actual errors in the similarity detection process.

I'll fix the bug where the `IterativeMergeOrchestrator` isn't properly passing the `fileSystem` parameter to `FileDiffer.FindMostSimilarFiles`.

---

```diff
  		{
  			// Find the two most similar groups among remaining groups
- 			FileSimilarity? similarity = FileDiffer.FindMostSimilarFiles(remainingGroups, null);
+ 			FileSimilarity? similarity = FileDiffer.FindMostSimilarFiles(remainingGroups, fileSystem);
  
  			if (similarity == null)
```

---

Fixed the bug in `IterativeMergeOrchestrator` by properly passing the `fileSystem` parameter to the `FileDiffer.FindMostSimilarFiles` method instead of passing `null`. 

Now the method will use the same file system instance that was either provided to `StartIterativeMergeProcess` or initialized as a new `FileSystem()`, ensuring consistent behavior throughout the orchestration process and preventing potential null reference exceptions when accessing the file system.
