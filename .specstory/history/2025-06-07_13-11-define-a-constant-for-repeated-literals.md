# Define a constant for repeated literals (2025-06-07 23:11:32)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Define a constant instead of using this literal 'All files are identical' 4 times. [+3 locations]
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

Looking at the code, I can see the literal string "All files are identical" is used multiple times. I need to create a constant for it and replace all usages.

---



---

Now I need to replace all occurrences of the literal string with the constant:

---

Let me search for the specific locations:

I can see there are 4 occurrences in BatchProcessor.cs at lines 625, 704, 790, and 874. Let me replace them one by one:

---



---

Let me read the specific lines to see the exact whitespace:

---

Read file: BlastMerge.Core/Services/BatchProcessor.cs

---

Now I can see the exact format. Let me replace each occurrence one by one:

---



---

Let me search with more context around the first occurrence:

---



---

Let me just target the line with more specific context for the first occurrence:

---

Read file: BlastMerge.Core/Services/BatchProcessor.cs

---

Let me try a more specific search to replace all at once using a global search:

---



---

Let me target them with a larger context for the first one:

---



---

Let me try using grep to find a unique identifier and then replace each instance individually. Let me check what's unique around each occurrence:

---

Read file: BlastMerge.Core/Services/BatchProcessor.cs

---

Let me try targeting the first one with a unique distinguishing comment:

---



---

Great! Now let me replace the remaining three occurrences. Let me check what's unique about the second one:

---



---

Now let me find the third occurrence:

---



---

Now for the fourth and final occurrence:

---



---

Perfect! I've successfully resolved the linter error by:

1. Adding a private constant `AllFilesIdenticalMessage = "All files are identical"` at the top of the class
2. Replacing all 4 occurrences of the literal string `"All files are identical"` with the constant `AllFilesIdenticalMessage`

This eliminates the code duplication and follows the same pattern as the existing `OnlyOneFileFoundMessage` constant. The fix is concise and maintains consistency with the existing codebase structure.
