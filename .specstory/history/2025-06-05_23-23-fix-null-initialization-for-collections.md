# Fix null initialization for collections (2025-06-06 09:23:48)

Fix this bug...

The properties ContextBefore1, ContextAfter1, ContextBefore2, and ContextAfter2 were changed from being initialized to empty collections (`=[]`) to being initialized to null (`= null!`). This causes NullReferenceExceptions when consuming code attempts to access or iterate over these properties, as it expects non-null collections. The properties should be initialized to empty collections instead of null.

I can see the issue! The properties in `BlockContext.cs` are initialized to `null!` instead of empty collections, which will cause NullReferenceExceptions when consuming code tries to iterate over them. Let me fix this by initializing them to empty collections instead.

---

```diff
  	/// Gets or sets the context lines before the block in version 1
  	/// </summary>
- 	public ReadOnlyCollection<string> ContextBefore1 { get; set; } = null!;
+ 	public ReadOnlyCollection<string> ContextBefore1 { get; set; } = new ReadOnlyCollection<string>([]);
  
  	/// <summary>
  	/// Gets or sets the context lines after the block in version 1
  	/// </summary>
- 	public ReadOnlyCollection<string> ContextAfter1 { get; set; } = null!;
+ 	public ReadOnlyCollection<string> ContextAfter1 { get; set; } = new ReadOnlyCollection<string>([]);
  
  	/// <summary>
  	/// Gets or sets the context lines before the block in version 2
  	/// </summary>
- 	public ReadOnlyCollection<string> ContextBefore2 { get; set; } = null!;
+ 	public ReadOnlyCollection<string> ContextBefore2 { get; set; } = new ReadOnlyCollection<string>([]);
  
  	/// <summary>
  	/// Gets or sets the context lines after the block in version 2
  	/// </summary>
- 	public ReadOnlyCollection<string> ContextAfter2 { get; set; } = null!;
+ 	public ReadOnlyCollection<string> ContextAfter2 { get; set; } = new ReadOnlyCollection<string>([]);
  }
  
```

Perfect! I've fixed the bug by changing all four properties from being initialized to `null!` to being initialized to empty `ReadOnlyCollection<string>` instances. This ensures that:

1. **No NullReferenceExceptions**: Consuming code can safely iterate over these collections without null checks
2. **Consistent behavior**: All properties now have predictable, non-null default values
3. **Proper initialization**: Empty collections are more semantically correct than null for collection properties that represent "no context lines"

The properties `ContextBefore1`, `ContextAfter1`, `ContextBefore2`, and `ContextAfter2` are now properly initialized to empty collections, preventing any runtime exceptions when the consuming code tries to access or iterate over them.
