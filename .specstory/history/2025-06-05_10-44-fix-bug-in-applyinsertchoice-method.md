# Fix bug in ApplyInsertChoice method (2025-06-05 20:44:18)

Fix this bug...

In the `ApplyInsertChoice` method, explicit `break` statements were added for `BlockChoice` cases `UseVersion1`, `UseVersion2`, `UseBoth`, `Keep`, and `Remove`. This changes the behavior for these invalid choices from throwing an `InvalidOperationException` (via the default case) to silently doing nothing, potentially masking programming errors.

I can see the issue! In the `ApplyInsertChoice` method, there are explicit `break` statements for invalid choices that should instead fall through to the `default` case to throw an `InvalidOperationException`. This is masking programming errors by silently doing nothing instead of alerting developers to invalid usage.

Let me fix this:

Perfect! The fix removes the explicit `break` statements for the invalid choices (`UseVersion1`, `UseVersion2`, `UseBoth`, `Keep`, and `Remove`) and lets them fall through to the `default` case. Now when any of these invalid choices are used with an insertion block, the method will properly throw an `InvalidOperationException` instead of silently doing nothing.

This change restores the intended behavior of catching programming errors early and makes the code consistent with the other similar methods (`ApplyDeleteChoice` and `ApplyReplaceChoice`) that also throw exceptions for invalid choices.
