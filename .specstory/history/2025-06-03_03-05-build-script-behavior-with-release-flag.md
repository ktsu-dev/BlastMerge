# Build script behavior with release flag (2025-06-03 13:05:08)

_**User**_

@PSBuild.psm1 why did my build script push files to package repos from a branch build? does it not respect the "should release" flag?

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Looking at your PSBuild.psm1 file, I can see the issue! The package publishing logic is **not** respecting the "should release" flag (`$SHOULD_RELEASE`).

Let me trace the problematic logic:

## The Problem

In `Get-BuildConfiguration`, the `$SHOULD_RELEASE` flag is correctly calculated:

```powershell
$SHOULD_RELEASE = ($IS_MAIN -AND -NOT $IS_TAGGED -AND $IS_OFFICIAL)
```

However, in both `Invoke-DotNetPublish` and `Invoke-ReleaseWorkflow`, the package publishing logic only checks:

```powershell
# Publish packages if we have any and NuGet key is provided
$packages = @(Get-Item -Path $BuildConfiguration.PackagePattern -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue)
if ($packages.Count -gt 0 -and -not [string]::IsNullOrWhiteSpace($BuildConfiguration.NuGetApiKey)) {
    # Publishes packages regardless of branch/release status!
    Invoke-NuGetPublish -BuildConfiguration $BuildConfiguration
}
```

**It's missing a check for `$BuildConfiguration.ShouldRelease`!**

## The Fix

You need to add the `ShouldRelease` check to the package publishing conditions. Here's what you should change:

---

```diff
      }
  
-     # Publish packages if we have any and NuGet key is provided
+     # Publish packages if we have any and NuGet key is provided AND this is a release build
      $packages = @(Get-Item -Path $BuildConfiguration.PackagePattern -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue)
-     if ($packages.Count -gt 0 -and -not [string]::IsNullOrWhiteSpace($BuildConfiguration.NuGetApiKey)) {
+     if ($packages.Count -gt 0 -and -not [string]::IsNullOrWhiteSpace($BuildConfiguration.NuGetApiKey) -and $BuildConfiguration.ShouldRelease) {
          Write-StepHeader "Publishing NuGet Packages" -Tags "Invoke-NuGetPublish"
          try {
```

```diff
              Write-Information "Continuing with release process." -Tags "Invoke-NuGetPublish"
          }
+     } elseif ($packages.Count -gt 0 -and -not $BuildConfiguration.ShouldRelease) {
+         Write-Information "Packages found but skipping publication (not a release build: ShouldRelease=$($BuildConfiguration.ShouldRelease))" -Tags "Invoke-DotNetPublish"
      }
  
```

```diff
          }
  
-         # Publish packages if we have any and NuGet key is provided
+         # Publish packages if we have any and NuGet key is provided AND this is a release build
          $packages = @(Get-Item -Path $BuildConfiguration.PackagePattern -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue)
-         if ($packages.Count -gt 0 -and -not [string]::IsNullOrWhiteSpace($BuildConfiguration.NuGetApiKey)) {
+         if ($packages.Count -gt 0 -and -not [string]::IsNullOrWhiteSpace($BuildConfiguration.NuGetApiKey) -and $BuildConfiguration.ShouldRelease) {
              Write-StepHeader "Publishing NuGet Packages" -Tags "Invoke-NuGetPublish"
              try {
```

```diff
                  Write-Information "Continuing with release process." -Tags "Invoke-NuGetPublish"
              }
+         } elseif ($packages.Count -gt 0 -and -not $BuildConfiguration.ShouldRelease) {
+             Write-Information "Packages found but skipping publication (not a release build: ShouldRelease=$($BuildConfiguration.ShouldRelease))" -Tags "Invoke-ReleaseWorkflow"
          }
  
```

---

## Summary

The issue was that your build script was publishing packages to repositories **regardless** of whether it was a release build or not. The script was only checking:

1. ‚úÖ If packages exist 
2. ‚úÖ If NuGet API key is provided
3. ‚ùå **Missing**: If this is actually a release build (`ShouldRelease`)

Now the script will:
- **Only publish packages** when `ShouldRelease` is `true` (main branch + not tagged + official repo)
- **Skip publishing** for branch builds and provide clear logging about why it's skipping
- **Still create the packages** (for testing/validation) but not publish them

This means branch builds will still build and test your code, create packages locally for validation, but won't push them to public package repositories unless it's an actual release from the main branch.

_**User**_

does the github release respet the flags too?

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Good catch! Looking at the code, **GitHub release creation is also NOT fully respecting the `ShouldRelease` flag**.

Let me trace the logic:

## Current GitHub Release Logic

In `Invoke-CIPipeline`, there's a check for version increment type:

```powershell
if ($versionInfo.Data.VersionIncrement -eq "skip") {
    Write-Information "Skipping release: $($versionInfo.Data.IncrementReason)" -Tags "Invoke-CIPipeline"
    return // skips the release
}
```

But then in `Invoke-ReleaseWorkflow`, the GitHub release creation happens without checking `ShouldRelease`:

```powershell
# Create GitHub release
Write-StepHeader "Creating GitHub Release" -Tags "New-GitHubRelease"
Write-Information "Creating release for version $($BuildConfiguration.Version)..." -Tags "New-GitHubRelease"
New-GitHubRelease -BuildConfiguration $BuildConfiguration  // No ShouldRelease check!
```

## The Problem

The script will create GitHub releases from **any branch** as long as:
1. There are significant changes (not "skip" increment type)
2. The workflow runs

It should **only** create GitHub releases when `ShouldRelease` is true (main branch + not tagged + official repo).

## The Fix

Let me get the exact location and context:

Read file: scripts/PSBuild.psm1

---

Now I can fix the GitHub release creation:

---



---

Let me be more specific about the change:

---



---

Let me try with the actual lines around it:

---



---

Let me check the current line numbers more precisely:

---

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "Write-StepHeader "Creating GitHub Release"" ‚Ä¢ **3** files</summary>

</details>

---

Read file: scripts/PSBuild.psm1

---

I need to make the change directly to those specific lines:

---



---

Let me try a different approach - I'll replace the specific lines:

---

```diff
          }
  
-         # Create GitHub release
+         # Create GitHub release only if this is a release build
+         if ($BuildConfiguration.ShouldRelease) {
              Write-StepHeader "Creating GitHub Release" -Tags "New-GitHubRelease"
              Write-Information "Creating release for version $($BuildConfiguration.Version)..." -Tags "New-GitHubRelease"
              New-GitHubRelease -BuildConfiguration $BuildConfiguration | Write-InformationStream -Tags "New-GitHubRelease"
+         } else {
+             Write-Information "Skipping GitHub release creation (not a release build: ShouldRelease=$($BuildConfiguration.ShouldRelease))" -Tags "Invoke-ReleaseWorkflow"
+         }
  
          Write-StepHeader "Release Process Completed" -Tags "Invoke-ReleaseWorkflow"
```

---

Perfect! Now let me also check if there's a similar issue in the `Invoke-CIPipeline` function where it should also respect the `ShouldRelease` flag before calling the release workflow:

---

Read file: scripts/PSBuild.psm1

---

Looking at `Invoke-CIPipeline`, I see that it runs the release workflow unconditionally after the build workflow. However, the release workflow now properly checks `ShouldRelease` internally for both package publishing and GitHub release creation, so this is actually fine.

## Summary

**Yes, you're absolutely right!** GitHub release creation was **also not respecting the `ShouldRelease` flag**. 

### What I Fixed

1. **‚úÖ Package Publishing** - Now checks `ShouldRelease` (we fixed this first)
2. **‚úÖ GitHub Release Creation** - Now checks `ShouldRelease` (just fixed this)

### Current Behavior

Now your build script will:

- **Branch builds** (non-main, forks, etc.):
  - ‚úÖ Run build and tests
  - ‚úÖ Create packages locally (for validation) 
  - ‚ùå **Skip** publishing packages to repos
  - ‚ùå **Skip** creating GitHub releases
  - üìù Log clear messages about why it's skipping

- **Release builds** (main branch + official repo + not tagged):
  - ‚úÖ Run build and tests  
  - ‚úÖ Create packages locally
  - ‚úÖ **Publish** packages to repos
  - ‚úÖ **Create** GitHub releases

So yes, both package publishing **and** GitHub release creation were ignoring the `ShouldRelease` flag, but now both respect it properly!

what about winget?

Good catch! Let me check if there are any winget-related operations that also need to respect the `ShouldRelease` flag.

I can see that the PSBuild.psm1 file exports a `New-WingetPackages` function, but I don't see that function defined in the file! Let me search for where winget packages are actually created:

Based on the search results, it looks like the `New-WingetPackages` function was removed from the current PSBuild.psm1 file (based on the .specstory history showing it was integrated into `Invoke-DotNetPublish`), but the export is still there. 

However, looking at the current `Invoke-DotNetPublish` function, it seems like winget packages are created as part of the normal publishing process, but there's no separate winget-specific distribution that needs to respect the `ShouldRelease` flag.

Let me check if there are any winget-specific operations in the release workflow:
