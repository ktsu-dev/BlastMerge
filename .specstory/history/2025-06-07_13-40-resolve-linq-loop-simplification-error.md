# Resolve LINQ loop simplification error (2025-06-07 23:40:30)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Loops should be simplified using the "Where" LINQ method [+1 location]
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

---

Looking at the code, the linting error is likely referring to the `ProcessSubdirectories` method where there's a `foreach` loop with a `continue` statement that can be simplified using LINQ `Where`.

---

The fix replaces the `foreach` loop with a `continue` statement inside an `if` condition with a LINQ `Where` clause that filters out directories that should be skipped upfront. This eliminates the need for the `if`/`continue` logic and makes the code more concise and functional in style.
