# Fix temporary file handling issue (2025-06-05 20:43:37)

Fix this bug...

Replacing `Path.GetTempFileName()` with `Path.GetRandomFileName()` breaks temporary file handling. `GetTempFileName()` creates a file and returns a full path in the system temp directory, while `GetRandomFileName()` only returns a random filename string without creating a file or providing a path. This causes subsequent `File.WriteAllLines()` calls to attempt writing to the current working directory using just the filename, which can fail or write files to an incorrect location.

You're absolutely right! This is a critical bug. `Path.GetRandomFileName()` only returns a random filename string without any path, while `Path.GetTempFileName()` creates an actual temporary file in the system temp directory and returns the full path.

Let me fix this by replacing the `Path.GetRandomFileName()` calls with `Path.GetTempFileName()`:

Perfect! The bug is now fixed. Here's what the change accomplishes:

**Before (buggy):**
- `Path.GetRandomFileName()` returns just a filename like `"abc123.tmp"`
- `File.WriteAllLines(tempFile1, lines1)` tries to write to the current working directory
- This could fail or write files to the wrong location

**After (fixed):**
- `Path.GetTempFileName()` creates an actual temporary file in the system temp directory
- Returns the full path like `"C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\tmp1234.tmp"`
- `File.WriteAllLines()` now writes to the proper temp directory
- The file cleanup in the `finally` block will work correctly

This ensures that temporary files are created in the appropriate system temp directory and can be properly written to and cleaned up.

For the code present, we get this error:
```
'Path.GetTempFileName()' is insecure. Use 'Path.GetRandomFileName()' instead.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.
