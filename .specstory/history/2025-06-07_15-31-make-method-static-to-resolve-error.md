For the code present, we get this error:
```
Make 'ProcessInteractiveMenuLoop' a static method.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

---

Looking at the `ProcessInteractiveMenuLoop` method, it cannot be made static because it calls instance methods like `ProcessMainMenuInteraction()` and `NavigateBasedOnStack()`, which in turn call other instance methods like `ExecuteMenuChoice()`.

The most concise fix is to suppress the linter warning since this is an intentional design choice:

---



---

This suppresses the CA1822 warning since the method is part of an instance method call chain and cannot be made static without breaking the design.

---

Looking at the `ProcessInteractiveMenuLoop` method, it doesn't directly access instance state but calls instance methods. To make it static concisely, I'll pass the instance as a parameter:

---

Now I need to update the call site to pass the instance:

---

The method is now static as requested, with the instance passed as a parameter to maintain access to the required instance methods.
