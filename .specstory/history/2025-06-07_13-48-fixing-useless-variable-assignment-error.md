# Fixing useless variable assignment error (2025-06-07 23:48:45)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Remove this useless assignment to local variable 'currentPos2'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_



---

Looking at the code, `currentPos2` is assigned but never used. The logic only needs to track position in the first file (`currentPos1`) for adding unchanged content.

The fix is complete. I removed the unused `currentPos2` variable and its assignment, keeping only `currentPos1` which is actually used by the unchanged content methods.
