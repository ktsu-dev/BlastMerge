I'll help you fix these build errors. Let me first examine the relevant files to understand the current state and then fix each issue.

---

Read file: BlastMerge.Core/FileGroup.cs

---

Read file: BlastMerge.Core/BlockMerger.cs

---

Read file: BlastMerge.Core/DiffPlexDiffer.cs

---

Read file: BlastMerge.Core/FileDiffer.cs

---

Now let me check the DiffBlock and ColoredDiffLine classes to understand their constructors:

</details>

Now I have a clear understanding of the issues. Let me fix them one by one:

1. **FileGroup.cs**: There are ambiguous constructors. The issue is there are two constructors that can both take a single parameter but are confusing to the compiler.
2. **DiffBlock.cs**: The record now requires a `BlockType` parameter, but some constructors are not providing it.
3. **ColoredDiffLine.cs**: The record requires both `Content` and `DiffColor` parameters, but some code is using object initializers.

Let me fix these issues:

---

```diff
  /// </summary>
  /// <param name="Hash"> Gets the hash that identifies this group </param>
- public record FileGroup(string Hash)
+ public record FileGroup(string Hash = "")
  {
  	private readonly Collection<string> filePaths = [];
```

```diff
  	/// </summary>
  	public IReadOnlyCollection<string> FilePaths => filePaths.AsReadOnly();
- 
- 	/// <summary>
- 	/// Initializes a new instance of the FileGroup class
- 	/// </summary>
- 	public FileGroup() : this(default) { }
  
  	/// <summary>
  	/// Initializes a new instance of the FileGroup class with the specified file paths
  	/// </summary>
  	/// <param name="filePaths">The file paths to include in this group</param>
- 	public FileGroup(IEnumerable<string> filePaths) : this(default)
+ 	public FileGroup(IEnumerable<string> filePaths) : this("")
  	{
  		ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(filePaths);
```

---

```diff
  		}
  
- 		var currentBlock = new DiffBlock();
+ 		var currentBlock = new DiffBlock(BlockType.Insert);
  		var isFirstDifference = true;
  
```

```diff
  				}
  
- 				currentBlock = new DiffBlock();
+ 				currentBlock = new DiffBlock(BlockType.Insert);
  				AddDifferenceToBlock(currentBlock, diff);
  			}
```

---

Now I need to fix the part where the DiffBlock.Type property is being assigned. Since it's an init-only property, I need to create new instances with the correct type instead of modifying the property:

---

Read file: BlastMerge.Core/BlockMerger.cs

---

I see the issue now. The problem is that the `DiffBlock.Type` property is init-only (since it's part of the record definition), but the code is trying to assign to it after construction. I need to refactor the approach to create blocks with the correct type from the start, rather than trying to modify the type later.

Let me refactor the `AddDifferenceToBlock` method and the block creation logic:

---

```diff
  		}
  
- 		var currentBlock = new DiffBlock(BlockType.Insert);
- 		var isFirstDifference = true;
+ 		DiffBlock? currentBlock = null;
  
  		foreach (var diff in sortedDifferences)
  		{
- 			// If this is the first difference or it's contiguous with the previous one
- 			if (isFirstDifference || IsContiguousDifference(currentBlock, diff))
- 			{
- 				AddDifferenceToBlock(currentBlock, diff);
- 				isFirstDifference = false;
- 			}
- 			else
+ 			// If this is the first difference or it's not contiguous with the previous one
+ 			if (currentBlock == null || !IsContiguousDifference(currentBlock, diff))
  			{
  				// Finalize the current block and start a new one
- 				if (currentBlock.Lines1.Count > 0 || currentBlock.Lines2.Count > 0)
+ 				if (currentBlock != null && (currentBlock.Lines1.Count > 0 || currentBlock.Lines2.Count > 0))
  				{
  					blocks.Add(currentBlock);
  				}
  
- 				currentBlock = new DiffBlock(BlockType.Insert);
- 				AddDifferenceToBlock(currentBlock, diff);
+ 				// Determine block type based on the difference
+ 				var blockType = DetermineBlockType(diff);
+ 				currentBlock = new DiffBlock(blockType);
  			}
+ 
+ 			AddDifferenceToBlock(currentBlock, diff);
  		}
  
  		// Add the final block
- 		if (currentBlock.Lines1.Count > 0 || currentBlock.Lines2.Count > 0)
+ 		if (currentBlock != null && (currentBlock.Lines1.Count > 0 || currentBlock.Lines2.Count > 0))
  		{
  			blocks.Add(currentBlock);
```

```diff
  		return blocks;
  	}
+ 
+ 	/// <summary>
+ 	/// Determines the block type based on a line difference
+ 	/// </summary>
+ 	/// <param name="diff">The line difference to analyze</param>
+ 	/// <returns>The appropriate block type</returns>
+ 	private static BlockType DetermineBlockType(LineDifference diff)
+ 	{
+ 		if (diff.LineNumber1.HasValue && diff.LineNumber2.HasValue)
+ 		{
+ 			return BlockType.Replace;
+ 		}
+ 		else if (diff.LineNumber1.HasValue)
+ 		{
+ 			return BlockType.Delete;
+ 		}
+ 		else
+ 		{
+ 			return BlockType.Insert;
+ 		}
+ 	}
  
  	/// <summary>
```

---

Now I need to update the `AddDifferenceToBlock` method to remove the part that tries to assign to the `Type` property:

---

```diff
  			currentBlock.LineNumbers2.Add(diff.LineNumber2.Value);
  		}
- 
- 		// Determine block type
- 		if (currentBlock.Lines1.Count > 0 && currentBlock.Lines2.Count > 0)
- 		{
- 			currentBlock.Type = BlockType.Replace;
- 		}
- 		else if (currentBlock.Lines1.Count > 0)
- 		{
- 			currentBlock.Type = BlockType.Delete;
- 		}
- 		else if (currentBlock.Lines2.Count > 0)
- 		{
- 			currentBlock.Type = BlockType.Insert;
- 		}
  	}
  
```

---

Now I need to fix the ColoredDiffLine constructor issues in DiffPlexDiffer.cs and FileDiffer.cs:

---

```diff
  		var result = new Collection<ColoredDiffLine>
  		{
- 			new() { Content = $"--- {file1}", Color = DiffColor.FileHeader },
- 			new() { Content = $"+++ {file2}", Color = DiffColor.FileHeader }
+ 			new($"--- {file1}", DiffColor.FileHeader),
+ 			new($"+++ {file2}", DiffColor.FileHeader)
  		};
  
```

---

```diff
  		{
  			// Add header
- 			new() {
- 				Content = $"Change Summary: {Path.GetFileName(file1)} vs {Path.GetFileName(file2)}",
- 				Color = DiffColor.FileHeader
- 			},
- 			new() {
- 				Content = "----------------------------------------",
- 				Color = DiffColor.Default
- 			}
+ 			new($"Change Summary: {Path.GetFileName(file1)} vs {Path.GetFileName(file2)}", DiffColor.FileHeader),
+ 			new("----------------------------------------", DiffColor.Default)
  		};
  
```

---

Now let's try building the project to see if we've fixed all the issues:

---

```bash
dotnet build
```

```
 PS C:\dev\ktsu-dev\BlastMerge >
  02:45:11   BlastMerge 
  12:45:11 commandlineparser  ?4 ~5
 PS C:\dev\ktsu-dev\BlastMerge >


























  02:45:11   BlastMerge  
  12:45:12 commandlineparser  ?4 ~5 
 PS C:\dev\ktsu-dev\BlastMerge >
```

---

The build appears to have completed without errors. Let me run it again to make sure we see the output clearly:

---

```bash
dotnet build --verbosity normal
```

```
  02:45:18   BlastMerge   1 - ERROR 
  12:45:18 commandlineparser  ?4 ~5 
 PS C:\dev\ktsu-dev\BlastMerge >




```

---

It looks like there's still an error. Let me try running the build to see the full error output:

---



---

Ah, now we have a style rule violation on line 157. Let me check that line and fix it:

---

Read file: BlastMerge.Core/BlockMerger.cs

---

I see the issue is in the `DetermineBlockType` method around line 157. The style rule suggests that the if-else-if-else chain can be simplified. Let me fix it:

---

```diff
  	private static BlockType DetermineBlockType(LineDifference diff)
  	{
- 		if (diff.LineNumber1.HasValue && diff.LineNumber2.HasValue)
- 		{
- 			return BlockType.Replace;
- 		}
- 		else if (diff.LineNumber1.HasValue)
- 		{
- 			return BlockType.Delete;
- 		}
- 		else
- 		{
- 			return BlockType.Insert;
- 		}
+ 		return diff.LineNumber1.HasValue && diff.LineNumber2.HasValue ? BlockType.Replace :
+ 			   diff.LineNumber1.HasValue ? BlockType.Delete :
+ 			   BlockType.Insert;
  	}
  
```

---

Now let's try building again:

---



---

Perfect! The build now succeeds with no warnings or errors. Let me also run the tests to make sure our changes haven't broken anything:

---



---

Excellent! All tests are passing as well. Let me summarize what I fixed:

## Summary of Build Error Fixes

I successfully fixed all 11 build errors:

### 1. **FileGroup.cs - Ambiguous Constructor Calls (2 errors)**
- **Problem**: Two constructors `FileGroup(string)` and `FileGroup(FileGroup)` were ambiguous when called with `FileGroup(default)`
- **Solution**: 
  - Made the Hash parameter optional with a default value: `FileGroup(string Hash = "")`
  - Removed the parameterless constructor
  - Updated the constructor that takes `IEnumerable<string>` to call `this("")` instead of `this(default)`

### 2. **BlockMerger.cs - DiffBlock Constructor Missing Parameter (2 errors)**
- **Problem**: `DiffBlock` constructor now requires a `BlockType` parameter, but code was calling `new DiffBlock()`
- **Solution**: Refactored the block creation logic to determine the block type upfront and create blocks with the correct type:
  - Added `DetermineBlockType` method to analyze differences and return appropriate `BlockType`
  - Updated `ConvertDifferencesToBlocks` to create blocks with the correct type from the start

### 3. **BlockMerger.cs - Init-only Property Assignment (3 errors)**
- **Problem**: Code was trying to assign to `DiffBlock.Type` property after construction, but it's init-only
- **Solution**: Removed the code that tried to modify the `Type` property after construction since it's now set correctly at creation time

### 4. **DiffPlexDiffer.cs - ColoredDiffLine Constructor Missing Parameters (2 errors)**
- **Problem**: Code was using object initializer syntax `new() { Content = ..., Color = ... }` but `ColoredDiffLine` constructor requires both parameters
- **Solution**: Changed to use the proper constructor: `new ColoredDiffLine(content, color)`

### 5. **FileDiffer.cs - ColoredDiffLine Constructor Missing Parameters (2 errors)**
- **Problem**: Same issue as above with object initializer syntax
- **Solution**: Same fix - changed to use the proper constructor syntax

### 6. **Style Rule Violation (IDE0046)**
- **Problem**: Complex if-else-if-else chain could be simplified
- **Solution**: Converted to a conditional expression for better readability

All errors are now resolved, the project builds successfully, and all 52 tests pass!
