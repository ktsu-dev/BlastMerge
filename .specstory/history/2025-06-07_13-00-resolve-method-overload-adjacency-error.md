# Resolve method overload adjacency error (2025-06-07 23:00:25)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
All 'ProcessSinglePattern' method overloads should be adjacent. [+1 location]
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

Looking at the code, I can see that the `ProcessSinglePattern` method overloads are scattered throughout the file instead of being grouped together. The linter wants all overloads of the same method to be adjacent.

Let me fix this by moving the methods to group the overloads together:

Perfect! I've fixed the issue by reordering the methods so that:

1. Both `ProcessSinglePattern` overloads are now adjacent (lines ~610-737)
2. The `ProcessSinglePatternWithPaths` method follows after them

This resolves the linter error by grouping all overloads of the same method name together, which is the C# coding convention the linter is enforcing.
