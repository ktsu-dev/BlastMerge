# Suggest a new name for merging app (2025-05-30 21:00:22)

_**User**_

please help me think of a better name for this app, its more about merging than diffing now, and a bunch of my other apps have "aplosive" themes like "SemTex", "MemFrag", "MuzzleFlash",

---

_**Assistant**_

I'd be happy to help you brainstorm a better name for your app! Let me first take a look at what your app does to suggest names that fit both its functionality and your explosive theme.

Based on my exploration of your codebase, I can see that this is an interactive file comparison and merging tool with sophisticated functionality. The app performs:

- **Iterative merging** of multiple file versions using similarity algorithms
- **Interactive conflict resolution** with visual TUI interfaces
- **Block-level merging** with user choice for each difference
- **Directory comparison** and file synchronization
- **Smart merge orchestration** that finds the most similar files to merge progressively

Now for some explosive-themed name suggestions that fit your pattern with "SemTex", "MemFrag", and "MuzzleFlash":

## **Top Recommendations:**

1. **FuseMerge** - Playing on the idea of fusing files together, like a fuse that ignites an explosive merge
2. **BlastMerge** - Direct reference to explosive blasting while highlighting the merging functionality  
3. **DetFuse** - Short for "Detonator Fuse" - the tool that triggers the merge explosion
4. **MergeTNT** - Classic explosive with clear merge functionality
5. **FuseBox** - The control center where all the explosive merging happens

## **Other Creative Options:**

- **IgniteMerge** - The spark that ignites file merging
- **DetonMerge** - Short for detonation + merge
- **CordTex** - Playing on your "SemTex" pattern, but "Cord" refers to detonating cord used to sync explosions (like syncing files)
- **FragMerge** - Following your "MemFrag" pattern
- **PrimeCord** - Prime explosive + detonating cord
- **FlashMerge** - Following your "MuzzleFlash" pattern
- **BangMerge** - Simple and explosive
- **SyncTex** - Synchronization + explosive suffix like SemTex

Given your current apps' naming style and the sophisticated merging functionality, I'd lean toward **FuseMerge** or **DetFuse** as they capture both the explosive theme and the core functionality in a memorable way.

What do you think? Any of these resonate with you, or would you like me to brainstorm variations on a particular theme?

_**User**_

BlastMerge could be good

---

_**Assistant**_



---

**BlastMerge** is an excellent choice! It perfectly captures both your explosive theme and the core functionality. The name is:

- **Memorable** and fits your existing app family (SemTex, MemFrag, MuzzleFlash)
- **Descriptive** - immediately tells users it's about merging with power/impact
- **Professional** enough for a developer tool while still being fun
- **Action-oriented** - suggests the tool will blast through merge conflicts efficiently

The imagery works great too - "blasting" files together, "explosive" conflict resolution, "detonating" differences between versions.

Would you like me to help you rename the project from "DiffMore" to "BlastMerge"? This would involve updating:

- Project names (`DiffMore.Core` → `BlastMerge.Core`, etc.)
- Namespaces throughout the codebase
- Assembly names and package references
- Documentation files (README, DESCRIPTION, etc.)
- Directory names
- Solution file
- Any hardcoded references in the code

I can systematically go through and update all these references if you'd like to make the switch. Just let me know if you want to proceed with the renaming!

_**User**_

lets start by making sure all the documentation is completely up to date with the current implementaion

Read file: README.md

---

Read file: DESCRIPTION.md

---

Read file: CHANGELOG.md

---

Read file: VERSION.md

---

Read file: TAGS.md

---

Read file: AUTHORS.md

---

Now let me check what the actual console app help says to understand the full feature set:

---

Read file: DiffMore.ConsoleApp/Program.cs

---

Now I'll update all the documentation files with accurate information based on the implementation. Let me start with the main README:

---

```diff

Let me also check if there are any other documentation files in the project structure:

---

</details>

---

Let me check if there's a README in the scripts directory:

---

Read file: scripts/README.md

---

The scripts README is for the PSBuild module, which is fine. Let me check the console app's project file to see if there are any assembly attributes that need updating:

---

Read file: DiffMore.ConsoleApp/DiffMore.ConsoleApp.csproj

---

Let me check the core library project file:

---

Read file: DiffMore.Core/DiffMore.Core.csproj

---

Let me check the Directory.Packages.props to see what dependencies are being used:

---

Read file: Directory.Packages.props

---

Let me also check the main Program.cs file to see if it has any additional functionality or entry point we should mention:

---

Read file: Program.cs

---

This appears to be a test/demo program. Let me check what's the actual executable name by looking at the console app:

---

Read file: DiffMore.ConsoleApp/Program.cs

---

Perfect! Now I have all the information I need. The actual executable is the console app in `DiffMore.ConsoleApp`, so the command should probably be `DiffMore.ConsoleApp` or just `DiffMore` depending on how it's built. Let me check the solution file to see the project structure:

---

Read file: DiffMore.sln

---

Now let me update the README to fix the command line usage example since it should be `DiffMore.ConsoleApp` (or just `DiffMore` if it gets renamed during build):

---

```diff
  ```bash
  # Compare files with the same name across directories
- DiffMore.CLI <directory> <filename>
+ DiffMore.ConsoleApp <directory> <filename>
  ```
  
```

```diff
  
  ```bash
- DiffMore.CLI
+ DiffMore.ConsoleApp
  ```
  
```

---

Perfect! Now all the documentation is comprehensive and accurate. Let me provide a summary of what we've updated:
