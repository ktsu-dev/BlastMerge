I can see you have build errors related to missing `Deconstruct` methods on the `ColorCodePair` type. Let me examine the problematic code and fix it.

---

Read file: BlastMerge.Core/Services/FileDiffer.cs

---

Now let me look at the `ColorCodePair` type to understand its structure:

I can see the issue. The code in `FileDiffer.cs` is trying to use tuple deconstruction syntax (`(string prefix, string suffix) = GetColorCodes(...)`) on lines 448 and 460, but the `ColorCodePair` record doesn't have a `Deconstruct` method. Let me add the `Deconstruct` method to the `ColorCodePair` record:

---

Read file: BlastMerge.Core/Models/ColorCodePair.cs

---

Now I'll add the `Deconstruct` method to the `ColorCodePair` record to enable tuple deconstruction:

---



---

Now let's build the project to see if the errors are resolved:

no ive been removing tuples dont make more

---

You're right, I should fix the code to not use tuple deconstruction instead of adding the `Deconstruct` method. Let me revert the change to `ColorCodePair.cs` and fix the code in `FileDiffer.cs`:
