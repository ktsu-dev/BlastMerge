# Resolve LINQ loop simplification error (2025-06-07 23:42:49)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Loops should be simplified using the "Where" LINQ method [+1 location]
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

---

Looking at the code, the linter is likely complaining about the `foreach` loop in the `ShouldExcludePath` method (lines 256-268) that could be simplified using LINQ methods.

---



---

I need to remove the unreachable `return false;` statement since the method now returns the result of the LINQ expression directly.

---



---

The fix simplifies the loop by using LINQ's `Any()` method instead of a `foreach` loop with early return. This eliminates the linter warning by replacing the imperative loop with a more functional approach using LINQ.
