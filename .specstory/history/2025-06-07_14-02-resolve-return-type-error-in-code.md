# Resolve return type error in code (2025-06-08 00:02:31)

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Change return type to 'void'; not a single caller uses the returned value.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

Looking at the code, the issue is with the `ExecuteFileOperation` method. It returns a `bool` indicating success/failure, but all the callers ignore the return value.

The fix is to change its return type from `bool` to `void`:

---



---

The fix removes the `bool` return type and all `return` statements from `ExecuteFileOperation`, since none of the callers were using the returned value anyway. The method now simply executes the file operation and handles exceptions without returning a success/failure indicator.

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Do not update the loop counter 'i' within the loop body.

Looking at the code, the issue is in the `RenderColoredDiff` method where `i++` is used within the loop body to skip processed lines. The fix is to use a `while` loop instead of a `for` loop:

---



---

The fix converts the `for` loop to a `while` loop where we explicitly control the increment. When processing character-level diffs, we increment by 2 to skip both processed lines, otherwise we increment by 1. This eliminates the need to modify the loop counter within the loop body.
