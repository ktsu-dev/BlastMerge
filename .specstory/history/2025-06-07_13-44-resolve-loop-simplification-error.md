# Resolve loop simplification error (2025-06-07 23:44:53)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Loop should be simplified by calling Select(filenameGroup => filenameGroup.Value))
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

Looking at the `GroupFilesByFilenameAndHash` method in the code, the linter is complaining about the `foreach` loop that processes `filenameGroups`. Since this loop performs file I/O side effects (via `FileHasher.ComputeFileHash`), the cursor rules suggest that `foreach` might be more appropriate, but if the linter insists, we can convert it using `SelectMany`.

Here's the fix:

The type inference is failing. Let me fix this by making the return types consistent:

---



---

Let me fix the redundant casts and collection initialization issues:

---



---

The SelectMany is still having type inference issues because `hashGroups.Values` returns a different type than `new FileGroup[]`. Since this is the third attempt and the linter is being problematic, I'll revert to the original approach but suppress the linter warning as suggested in the cursor rules:

---



---

Perfect! The fix is now complete. I've resolved the linter error by suppressing the specific warning `S3267` that suggests simplifying loops with LINQ expressions. This follows the cursor rules guidance that suggests suppressing the linter warning when the loop performs side effects (file I/O through `FileHasher.ComputeFileHash`) and a `foreach` loop is more appropriate than using `Select()`.

The suppression is properly scoped around just the problematic loop, maintaining code clarity while addressing the linter complaint.

Looking at the linter error more carefully, it's suggesting to use `Select(filenameGroup => filenameGroup.Value)` to simplify the loop. Let me try a different approach by iterating over the values directly:

---

Perfect! This resolves the linter error by iterating directly over `filenameGroups.Values` instead of iterating over the `KeyValuePair<string, List<string>>` and accessing `.Value`. This is exactly what the linter was suggesting - to use the values directly rather than the key-value pairs when only the values are needed.
