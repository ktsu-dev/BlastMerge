> Cross-repository file synchronization through intelligent iterative merging

## Overview

BlastMerge is a revolutionary file synchronization tool that uses **intelligent iterative merging** to unify multiple versions of files across repositories, directories, and codebases. Unlike traditional diff tools, BlastMerge progressively merges file versions by finding the most similar pairs and resolving conflicts interactively, ultimately synchronizing entire file ecosystems into a single, unified version.

## üöÄ Iterative File Synchronization

### **The Problem**

When working across multiple repositories, branches, or environments, the same files often diverge into multiple versions with overlapping changes. Traditional merge tools handle two-way merges, but when you have 3, 5, or 10+ versions of the same file scattered across different locations, manual synchronization becomes a nightmare.

### **The Solution: Iterative Merging**

BlastMerge solves this by:

1. **Smart Discovery**: Automatically finds all versions of a file across directories/repositories
2. **Hash-Based Grouping**: Groups identical files and identifies unique versions
3. **Similarity Analysis**: Calculates similarity scores between all version pairs
4. **Optimal Merge Order**: Progressively merges the most similar versions first to minimize conflicts
5. **Interactive Resolution**: Visual TUI for resolving conflicts block-by-block
6. **Cross-Repository Sync**: Updates all file locations with the final merged result

### **Real-World Use Cases**

-   **Multi-Repository Synchronization**: Sync the same configuration files across microservices
-   **Branch Consolidation**: Merge scattered feature branch changes before cleanup
-   **Environment Alignment**: Unify deployment scripts across dev/staging/prod environments
-   **Code Migration**: Consolidate similar files when merging codebases
-   **Documentation Sync**: Align README files across related projects

## Installation

Add the NuGet package:

```bash
dotnet add package ktsu.BlastMerge
```

## Usage

### Primary Workflow: Iterative File Synchronization

```bash
# Launch interactive mode for iterative merging
BlastMerge.ConsoleApp

# Select "üîÄ Iterative Merge"
# 1. Specify the directory containing your repositories/projects
# 2. Enter the filename pattern (e.g., "README.md", "config.json", "*.yml")
# 3. Watch as BlastMerge finds all versions and merges them optimally
# 4. Resolve conflicts interactively when needed
# 5. All file locations are automatically updated with the unified result
```

### Command Line Mode

```bash
# Quick comparison for files with the same name across directories
BlastMerge.ConsoleApp <directory> <filename>

# Run a saved batch configuration
BlastMerge.ConsoleApp <directory> -b <batch-name>

# List available batch configurations
BlastMerge.ConsoleApp -l

# Show version information
